SVG-based basic calculator using Javascript

Basic calculator with crude "stone-age" interface demonstrating use of SVG with Javascript.  Allows use of keyboard operation.
Operand prescedence in this calculator is strictly order of entry.  One operational quirk is the result is limited to 12 characters including the decimal (if present).  Values exceeding 12 characters will have the rightmost digits truncated.

INSTALLATION:
Copy files to a local directory and point a browser to:
